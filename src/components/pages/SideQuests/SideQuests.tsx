      <h2>What</h2>
      <p>
        In my last WTR I made a list of things I had learned in my free time. For tradition's sake I'll do it again.

        <h3>Machine Learning</h3>
        <p>
          ML was very important to my job, so I spent a lot of time learning about it to gain potential insights. 
          I read some stuff from RBC Borealis on Linear Models, NTK, and the Bayesian approach, which was super cool.
          I read a bunch of the papers from Ilya's 30u30, which was super fun because they were mostly chronological and you could watch AI evolve from RNNs to LSTMs to Attention-Based Networks to Transformers in real time. Aside from that I just read a bunch of random blogs and papers to flesh out my understanding.

        <h3>Neetcode</h3>
        <p>
          Did more neetcode. God I really hate these. I can't wait until AI nukes software engineering so these things will get out of interviews.

        <h3>Books</h3>
        <p>
          Read the Iliad and like 3/4 of the Odyssey. Read some German drama stuff by Arthur Schnitzler. Read some essays by Richard Wagner. Read some John Locke but gave up around 80 pages in because my brain was just too tired after work to really register what he was saying.

        <h3>Calc 2</h3>
        <p>
          Read through all the notes of the calc 2 class I'm taking right after the work term. I've historically kinda sucked at Math so just a lil safety net.
